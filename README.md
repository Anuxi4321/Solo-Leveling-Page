This is just a simple program that showcases HTML and CSS. 
- HTML fow the images of the code
- CSS for the background color, sizes of the images and the hover effect as well.

Added new features
- Added a gif so that when you hover to the image, the Gif will play instead of the image just zooming.
- Also added an audio which is the Solo Leveling OST
